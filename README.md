# Utility to download transcripts of youtube videos
Easily download transcripts of a list of youtube videos

# How to use Youtube Transcripts:

1) Place the "youtube_transcripts.exe" file and the "links.csv" file in the same folder.

2) Paste the Youtube links for which transcripts are needed under the "links" column. Keep the format of the excel file as ".csv" (select csv under the "save as" option after editing).

3) Double click the "youtube_transcripts.exe" file.

4) Wait for the program to finish executing.

5) Two folders have been created.

	- The folder named "transcripts" contain the transcripts in plaintext (.txt)

	- The folder named "subs" contain the transcripts in .vtt format

6) Nomenclature of the files are : [name of the video].[language code (ISO 639-1)].[file extension]

	- Example: Negotiating M&A deal terms.en.txt


# What it does

For videos which have transcripts uploaded by users in English, Korean or Mandarin, all which exist are downloaded.
For videos which only have transcripts generated by YouTube, only English transcripts are downloaded if no uploaded transcripts are found.
In case a transcript doesn't exist for a video, the video is skipped.
