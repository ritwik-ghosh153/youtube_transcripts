so that's typically how we do it
i<00:04:02.000><c> would</c><00:04:02.319><c> think</c><00:04:02.560><c> that</c><00:04:02.799><c> as</c><00:04:03.040><c> a</c><00:04:03.120><c> strategic</c><00:04:03.760><c> you're</c>

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
i would think that as a strategic you're
 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.830 align:start position:0%
i would think that as a strategic you're

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.070 align:start position:0%
probably thinking about it differently
yeah<00:04:06.239><c> so</c><00:04:06.480><c> i</c><00:04:06.720><c> i</c><00:04:07.200><c> think</c><00:04:07.360><c> there</c><00:04:07.519><c> were</c><00:04:07.599><c> quite</c><00:04:07.760><c> a</c><00:04:07.840><c> few</c>

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 align:start position:0%
yeah so i i think there were quite a few
 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.910 align:start position:0%
yeah so i i think there were quite a few

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 align:start position:0%

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.190 align:start position:0%
strategics here so as a strategic we

um<00:16:57.680><c> then</c><00:16:58.800><c> i</c><00:16:58.880><c> guess</c><00:16:59.199><c> turning</c><00:16:59.519><c> to</c><00:16:59.600><c> how</c><00:16:59.839><c> you</c>

00:17:00.069 --> 00:17:00.079 align:start position:0%
um then i guess turning to how you
 

00:17:00.079 --> 00:17:02.550 align:start position:0%
um then i guess turning to how you
negotiate<00:17:00.800><c> i</c><00:17:00.880><c> mean</c>

00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:02.560 align:start position:0%
negotiate i mean
 

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:05.029 align:start position:0%
negotiate i mean
i<00:17:02.639><c> don't</c><00:17:02.800><c> know</c><00:17:03.040><c> if</c><00:17:03.759><c> focusing</c><00:17:04.319><c> on</c><00:17:04.480><c> particular</c>

a<00:24:42.400><c> huge</c><00:24:42.720><c> chunk</c><00:24:43.039><c> of</c><00:24:43.120><c> the</c><00:24:43.200><c> deal</c><00:24:43.520><c> consideration</c>

00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:44.480 align:start position:0%
a huge chunk of the deal consideration
 

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:46.070 align:start position:0%
a huge chunk of the deal consideration
was<00:24:44.720><c> was</c><00:24:44.960><c> in</c><00:24:45.039><c> their</c><00:24:45.279><c> pocket</c>

00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
was was in their pocket
 

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:48.310 align:start position:0%
was was in their pocket
so<00:24:46.240><c> it's</c><00:24:46.400><c> still</c><00:24:46.640><c> primarily</c><00:24:47.440><c> is</c><00:24:47.600><c> a</c><00:24:47.760><c> gap</c><00:24:48.000><c> bridger</c>

00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:48.320 align:start position:0%
so it's still primarily is a gap bridger
 

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:49.750 align:start position:0%
so it's still primarily is a gap bridger
and<00:24:48.480><c> again</c><00:24:48.720><c> you</c><00:24:48.799><c> might</c><00:24:48.960><c> have</c><00:24:49.120><c> founders</c><00:24:49.679><c> that</c>

00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:49.760 align:start position:0%

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:51.190 align:start position:0%
and again you might have founders that

00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:51.200 align:start position:0%
you want to keep happy you don't want to

00:24:52.799 --> 00:24:54.630 align:start position:0%

00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
um there can be a number of reasons
 

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:56.310 align:start position:0%
um there can be a number of reasons
maybe<00:24:54.960><c> the</c><00:24:55.120><c> fun</c><00:24:55.360><c> that</c><00:24:55.440><c> you're</c><00:24:55.679><c> buying</c><00:24:55.919><c> from</c><00:24:56.159><c> is</c>

00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:56.320 align:start position:0%
maybe the fun that you're buying from is

so<00:24:57.440><c> an</c><00:24:57.520><c> indemnity</c><00:24:58.000><c> from</c><00:24:58.159><c> them</c><00:24:58.400><c> isn't</c><00:24:58.640><c> worth</c>

00:24:58.950 --> 00:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
so an indemnity from them isn't worth
 

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:00.390 align:start position:0%
so an indemnity from them isn't worth
anything<00:24:59.360><c> or</c><00:24:59.440><c> they</c><00:24:59.600><c> know</c><00:24:59.760><c> they</c><00:25:00.000><c> can't</c><00:25:00.240><c> give</c>

yeah can happen yeah i think
 

00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:20.870 align:start position:0%
yeah can happen yeah i think
i<00:45:18.720><c> think</c><00:45:19.119><c> common</c><00:45:19.520><c> expectations</c><00:45:20.240><c> were</c><00:45:20.480><c> that</c>

00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
i think common expectations were that
 

00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:22.309 align:start position:0%
i think common expectations were that
most<00:45:21.200><c> claims</c><00:45:21.440><c> would</c><00:45:21.599><c> come</c><00:45:21.760><c> in</c><00:45:21.839><c> within</c><00:45:22.160><c> that</c>

00:45:22.309 --> 00:45:22.319 align:start position:0%
most claims would come in within that
 

00:45:22.319 --> 00:45:23.670 align:start position:0%
most claims would come in within that
first<00:45:22.560><c> audit</c><00:45:22.880><c> cycle</c>

00:45:27.910 --> 00:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
reporting aig puts out a claim study and
 

00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:29.349 align:start position:0%
reporting aig puts out a claim study and
i<00:45:28.000><c> think</c><00:45:28.240><c> they</c><00:45:28.400><c> had</c><00:45:28.480><c> reported</c><00:45:28.960><c> where</c>

00:45:29.349 --> 00:45:29.359 align:start position:0%
i think they had reported where
 

00:45:29.359 --> 00:45:31.349 align:start position:0%
i think they had reported where
there<00:45:29.520><c> was</c><00:45:29.680><c> a</c><00:45:29.839><c> significant</c><00:45:30.400><c> number</c><00:45:30.640><c> of</c><00:45:30.880><c> claims</c>

00:45:31.349 --> 00:45:31.359 align:start position:0%
there was a significant number of claims
 

00:45:31.359 --> 00:45:33.030 align:start position:0%
there was a significant number of claims
that<00:45:31.599><c> would</c><00:45:31.839><c> come</c><00:45:32.079><c> in</c><00:45:32.240><c> after</c><00:45:32.480><c> the</c><00:45:32.560><c> 12-month</c>

00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
that would come in after the 12-month
 

00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:33.990 align:start position:0%
that would come in after the 12-month
period

00:45:33.990 --> 00:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
period
 

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:35.510 align:start position:0%

so<00:45:34.240><c> it's</c><00:45:34.480><c> it's</c><00:45:34.720><c> been</c><00:45:34.960><c> interesting</c><00:45:35.359><c> i</c><00:45:35.440><c> think</c>

00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
so it's it's been interesting i think
 

00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:38.150 align:start position:0%
