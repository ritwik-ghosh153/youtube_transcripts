00:00:07.402 --> 00:00:08.832
Thank you.

00:00:08.832 --> 00:00:12.353
So, the other day, I was giving a talk
to a bunch of young models

00:00:12.353 --> 00:00:15.773
on having a career
in the fashion industry.

00:00:15.773 --> 00:00:19.810
And, I really wanted to tell them
about my upcoming TED talk.

00:00:20.564 --> 00:00:23.754
So I go, "Hey guys,
has anyone here heard of TED?"

00:00:24.644 --> 00:00:28.284
And in typical model fashion,
this is the reply I get:

00:00:28.654 --> 00:00:32.116
"Yeah, I've seen them both,
and their teddy bear's hilarious."

00:00:32.116 --> 00:00:33.127
(Laughter)

00:00:33.127 --> 00:00:33.844
Like, what?!

00:00:33.844 --> 00:00:36.873
The youth of today,
it made me laugh so much.

00:00:37.213 --> 00:00:39.594
I mean, I can't really say much.

00:00:40.034 --> 00:00:42.585
When I was 15, I wanted
to be a bodybuilder.

00:00:43.555 --> 00:00:49.232
Not just any bodybuilder though,
the number one: Arnold Schwarzenegger.

00:00:50.044 --> 00:00:54.249
I actually remember day one
on my attempt to get a body like this guy.

00:00:54.865 --> 00:00:57.364
There was this local
old school gym in East London,

00:00:57.364 --> 00:01:00.292
and it looked like something
you might see in a "Rocky" movie.

00:01:00.722 --> 00:01:04.755
It was this converted garage space
with ripped black benches,

00:01:04.925 --> 00:01:06.545
rusting bar bells,

00:01:06.545 --> 00:01:09.613
and these posters of ex-bodybuilding
champions on the wall,

00:01:09.613 --> 00:01:13.906
including Schwarzenegger himself
as a goal to aspire to.

00:01:14.626 --> 00:01:17.216
Now, the day I walked in there,
I met the owner,

00:01:17.396 --> 00:01:19.826
this proper Cockney guy called Dave.

00:01:20.457 --> 00:01:24.536
I described to him my health and fitness
goals in great, lengthy detail,

00:01:24.536 --> 00:01:27.278
you know, just like
an adolescent kid does:

00:01:27.358 --> 00:01:29.320
"I want to get massive."

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.538
(Laughter)

00:01:30.538 --> 00:01:33.794
But he nodded, you know,
he really understood what I wanted.

00:01:34.283 --> 00:01:36.007
He pointed to the squat rack,

00:01:36.487 --> 00:01:37.997
and he says,

00:01:38.527 --> 00:01:41.543
"That over there, son,
[that's how] you get big legs.

00:01:42.144 --> 00:01:45.095
And that over there,
pull into the bench press.

00:01:45.565 --> 00:01:47.115
that's how you get a big chest.

00:01:47.562 --> 00:01:51.784
And these dumb bells
- here - for big arms.

00:01:52.104 --> 00:01:53.462
And that's about it.

00:01:53.462 --> 00:01:55.298
Now off you go, son."

00:01:55.298 --> 00:01:57.694
So off I did go, dad.

00:01:57.694 --> 00:02:00.665
I mean, it was a pretty
simple concept, really.

00:02:00.665 --> 00:02:04.224
If you can get from A to B
in eight repetitions,

00:02:04.414 --> 00:02:05.874
you just add more weight.

00:02:06.524 --> 00:02:09.953
Now, at this time in my life,
I hadn't yet studied sports science,

00:02:10.083 --> 00:02:13.516
so little did I know,
but this A to B method I was using,

00:02:13.516 --> 00:02:15.745
we refer to as "overload."

00:02:16.294 --> 00:02:18.715
Now, the overload theory works like this:

00:02:18.715 --> 00:02:20.706
If I push my body to failure,

00:02:20.706 --> 00:02:25.336
meaning I no longer have the capability
to do any more repetitions,

00:02:26.006 --> 00:02:29.526
then when I'm resting, my body
simply produces more muscle,

00:02:29.526 --> 00:02:31.593
and that allows me to lift more next time.

00:02:31.593 --> 00:02:35.202
I can then work around the body
using this method on each muscle group,

00:02:35.552 --> 00:02:38.938
and, Hey, presto, (Arnold voice)
one day you have body like Arnie.

00:02:39.358 --> 00:02:43.570
Well, I obviously do not have
a body like Arnie. (Laughs)

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.990
In fact, I have a body
like a fashion model.

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.010
That's because
I was scouted in the street

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.584
and was forced to give up
on my bodybuilding dream.

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.462
This is one of my first shows.

00:02:57.462 --> 00:03:00.712
This is me strutting down
the catwalk for Calvin Klein.

00:03:01.092 --> 00:03:05.673
The casting director - thank you -
was back stage before the show

00:03:05.673 --> 00:03:08.131
teaching us how to walk
in a strong posture.

00:03:08.361 --> 00:03:12.258
Feet straight, belly button in,
shoulders back and down.

00:03:13.322 --> 00:03:17.692
But why in my early 20s
was I being taught how to walk?

00:03:18.692 --> 00:03:22.594
More importantly, why did walking
this way feel so alien?

00:03:22.998 --> 00:03:27.842
But yet, on the outside, to the audience,
it looked quite powerful.

00:03:28.551 --> 00:03:32.360
I mean, all they were asking me to do
was walk like I was supposed to walk.

00:03:32.972 --> 00:03:36.612
So I decided to go to a place
where just being in strong posture

00:03:36.992 --> 00:03:38.483
was common practice.

00:03:39.023 --> 00:03:42.225
And I was about to meet
the person face to face

00:03:42.225 --> 00:03:47.477
that would destroy my aspiration
of Schwarzenegger forever.

00:03:48.946 --> 00:03:51.928
I was attempting an exercise
called a "bridge":

00:03:51.928 --> 00:03:53.818
an adult gymnastics class.

00:03:53.818 --> 00:03:55.970
And I just couldn't get my arms straight,

00:03:56.347 --> 00:03:58.269
let alone my body off the ground.

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:00.338
So the coach calls somebody over

00:04:00.648 --> 00:04:03.928
who demonstrates
this movement effortlessly.

00:04:05.518 --> 00:04:07.909
She was a six-year-old girl.

00:04:09.048 --> 00:04:10.373
This is actually her.

00:04:10.373 --> 00:04:11.619
Her name is Grace.

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:13.298
Amazing...

00:04:13.888 --> 00:04:15.037
Grace.

00:04:15.037 --> 00:04:16.049
(Laughs)

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.068
(Laughter)

00:04:17.068 --> 00:04:18.619
How sweet.

00:04:18.619 --> 00:04:20.127
(Laughter)

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:22.219
But what I really began to see

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:24.760
is the principles being used
in gymnastics class

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.600
were identical to the posture cues
I'd been given back stage

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.140
during Fashion Week.

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.289
It's the language of gymnastics
that's not based on individual muscles

00:04:34.829 --> 00:04:39.630
but based on movements
of the joints and the skeleton.

00:04:40.087 --> 00:04:44.718
For example, they use shoulder
instead of biceps, triceps;

00:04:44.718 --> 00:04:47.595
hips instead of quads, hamstrings.

00:04:48.095 --> 00:04:52.599
Completely the opposite to what
the fitness industry prioritizes.

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:55.949
Fitness talks muscles before spine.

00:04:56.438 --> 00:05:01.580
You see, gymnasts focus
on how they are moving their body.

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.698
And they also just happen
to have awesome posture

00:05:06.698 --> 00:05:08.558
and a really strong core.

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:10.808
It's really no coincidence.

00:05:10.808 --> 00:05:14.296
This is a byproduct
of working with the body.

00:05:14.946 --> 00:05:19.751
In fact, prioritization of the spine
is a much smarter approach.

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.723
If you happen to damage your spinal cord,

00:05:22.723 --> 00:05:26.753
you can actually lose the ability
to move any part of your body.

00:05:27.299 --> 00:05:30.639
And this is something
we've been reminded of our whole lives.

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:33.344
"Stop slouching."

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:35.522
"Sit up straight."

00:05:35.522 --> 00:05:37.053
"Engage your core!"

00:05:37.533 --> 00:05:39.633
"Get your elbows off the table."

00:05:40.063 --> 00:05:41.992
They all mean the same thing.

00:05:41.992 --> 00:05:44.472
All your parents were saying was:

00:05:44.472 --> 00:05:46.513
prioritize your spine.

00:05:47.425 --> 00:05:51.344
You see, the thing is, as humans,
we were born with full range of motion.

00:05:51.924 --> 00:05:55.555
Biochemist Esther Gokhale
spent time traveling the world

00:05:55.555 --> 00:05:59.454
and researched places
where back pain hardly exists.

00:05:59.867 --> 00:06:04.341
What she noticed was people's spines
with a flatter lumbar curvature

00:06:04.341 --> 00:06:06.064
didn't suffer from back pain.

00:06:06.734 --> 00:06:09.456
She referred to this as a J-shaped spine,

00:06:09.456 --> 00:06:12.185
and you can see the difference
in the images here

00:06:12.835 --> 00:06:17.135
between the S-shaped spine
taught in the Western world

00:06:17.135 --> 00:06:22.180
and the J-shaped spine in people
where back pain doesn't exist.

00:06:23.424 --> 00:06:27.185
Gokhale states the J-shaped spine
is what you see in Greek statues

00:06:27.615 --> 00:06:29.818
and in young children universally.

00:06:30.567 --> 00:06:36.038
What she's saying is,
we're all born with a J-shaped spine.

00:06:37.383 --> 00:06:38.648
Now, you may have noticed,

00:06:38.648 --> 00:06:41.038
when young children
pick things up from the ground,

00:06:41.038 --> 00:06:43.774
they drop down into this perfect squat.

00:06:44.828 --> 00:06:50.708
This kid, unlike myself,
did not need a casting director,

00:06:50.708 --> 00:06:55.388
nor a six-year-old amazing Grace
to teach him this move.

00:06:55.391 --> 00:06:57.737
In fact, nobody taught him.

00:06:58.207 --> 00:07:01.888
And no, guys, he's not exercising.

00:07:02.581 --> 00:07:08.019
This is, in fact, a pre-chair,
resting human position.

00:07:08.547 --> 00:07:12.508
But unfortunately, as a consequence
of our current human conditioning,

00:07:12.508 --> 00:07:14.147
or our culture,

00:07:14.147 --> 00:07:18.278
this natural resting position
is about to be taken away from this child.

00:07:19.108 --> 00:07:24.912
He's about to be taught
a resting position is, in fact, a chair.

00:07:26.033 --> 00:07:28.070
And when he's due to start school,

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:31.102
seven hours of his day, every day,

00:07:31.102 --> 00:07:35.726
he will be asked to sit
in this - quite frankly weird

00:07:35.726 --> 00:07:38.005
and unhuman - position.

00:07:38.425 --> 00:07:41.064
Now, I didn't even take into account
the amount of hours

00:07:41.064 --> 00:07:43.984
this kid spends watching Peppa Pig.

00:07:43.984 --> 00:07:45.155
(Laughter)

00:07:45.155 --> 00:07:47.529
According to the British
Chiropractic Association,

00:07:47.529 --> 00:07:51.723
the total number of people
off sick from work with back pain

00:07:51.723 --> 00:07:55.785
increased last year by 29 percent.

00:07:57.082 --> 00:08:01.516
From the survey, the reason for back pain
was sitting too long in one position.

00:08:02.423 --> 00:08:05.804
So I tried to find a survey totaling
the number of four-year-olds

00:08:05.804 --> 00:08:07.866
off sick from school with back pain.

00:08:08.067 --> 00:08:11.598
But would you believe it,
I just couldn't find one.

00:08:12.918 --> 00:08:15.608
You see, we are more than well aware.

00:08:15.608 --> 00:08:19.266
We are a generation
of sitting-on-our-backside human beings.

00:08:19.628 --> 00:08:23.587
But, the specific point I would like
to bring to your attention today

00:08:23.927 --> 00:08:27.117
is the fitness industry's
ignorance of the spine,

00:08:27.117 --> 00:08:30.429
to have us hooked on task completion.

00:08:31.307 --> 00:08:34.927
Time, weight, and distance.

00:08:34.927 --> 00:08:38.681
This is, for most people,
measures of improvement and progress.

00:08:38.984 --> 00:08:40.831
How long can you run for?

00:08:40.831 --> 00:08:42.340
How fast can you run?

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:43.791
How much can you lift?

00:08:43.791 --> 00:08:45.634
How many repetitions can you do?

00:08:45.634 --> 00:08:47.433
How many calories can you burn?

00:08:47.433 --> 00:08:49.165
This list is endless.

00:08:50.466 --> 00:08:52.025
But they're flawed.

00:08:53.049 --> 00:08:55.956
None of these take into account
how you're moving,

00:08:56.496 --> 00:08:59.801
or more importantly, how you once could.

00:09:00.189 --> 00:09:05.116
You see, nothing can ever compare,
or will measure up against,

00:09:05.116 --> 00:09:07.940
the exquisite movement
you had as a three-year-old.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:12.701
A study in 2012 found
that musculoskeletal conditions

00:09:12.701 --> 00:09:15.931
were the second greatest
cause of disability in the world,

00:09:16.501 --> 00:09:20.348
affecting over 1.7 billion
people worldwide.

00:09:21.433 --> 00:09:24.273
Professor Wolfe,
a world leader in healthcare,

00:09:24.743 --> 00:09:27.480
describes suffering
from musculoskeletal disorders

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:30.559
as being like a Ferrari without wheels.

00:09:31.043 --> 00:09:34.212
If you don't have mobility and dexterity,

00:09:34.212 --> 00:09:37.503
it doesn't matter how healthy
the rest of your body is.

00:09:38.536 --> 00:09:42.364
So surely the access
to a healthy physicality

00:09:42.784 --> 00:09:46.794
is working back towards
full range of motion,

00:09:47.514 --> 00:09:50.733
to understand how your body moves,

00:09:50.983 --> 00:09:55.094
and to be able to function like a human.

00:09:55.885 --> 00:10:01.523
Said simply, the ability to move
like you once could

00:10:02.093 --> 00:10:04.077
when you were a three year old.

00:10:04.577 --> 00:10:08.714
We can and should
start re-learning how to move

00:10:08.714 --> 00:10:10.714
from the examples of children,

00:10:11.494 --> 00:10:16.374
ditching these current measures
of time, weight, and distance,

00:10:16.854 --> 00:10:19.815
and spend time unravelling restrictions,

00:10:19.815 --> 00:10:23.392
getting back the movement
we actually once had.

00:10:24.474 --> 00:10:28.005
All that's left
is an aspiration of ourselves

00:10:28.005 --> 00:10:30.307
in the school playground as a child,

00:10:30.598 --> 00:10:33.807
able to play and move

00:10:34.166 --> 00:10:37.934
without fear of injury
and using our body's full potential.

00:10:38.781 --> 00:10:41.155
And those other results we're aiming for

00:10:41.155 --> 00:10:43.485
such as: slimmer physique,

00:10:43.965 --> 00:10:45.175
toned muscles,

00:10:45.515 --> 00:10:46.655
do come,

00:10:47.275 --> 00:10:51.826
but as a byproduct of moving the body
as it's designed to function best.

00:10:53.164 --> 00:10:55.156
There's a famous Chinese proverb:

00:10:56.013 --> 00:10:58.283
"You are as old as your spine."

00:10:59.645 --> 00:11:03.235
In all honesty, I'll have more chance
teaching penguins how to fly

00:11:03.235 --> 00:11:06.076
than humans a better way
to sit on a chair.

00:11:06.256 --> 00:11:09.146
We're just not designed to do it.

00:11:09.786 --> 00:11:13.706
Today, I'm going to leave you
with a powerful standing posture.

00:11:14.336 --> 00:11:17.495
In cultures where
the J-shaped spine exists,

00:11:17.495 --> 00:11:21.365
people's butt muscles engage
every time they take a step.

00:11:21.745 --> 00:11:24.454
It's one reason they have
these strong butt muscles

00:11:24.454 --> 00:11:26.396
that support their lower back.

00:11:27.063 --> 00:11:29.704
To demonstrate how
this standing posture works,

00:11:29.704 --> 00:11:32.146
I will need a bit
of audience participation.

00:11:32.964 --> 00:11:35.005
So I need you all to be standing.

00:11:35.005 --> 00:11:36.229
Sorry.

00:11:40.656 --> 00:11:43.137
Please stand with your feet together

00:11:43.277 --> 00:11:44.967
and facing forwards.

00:11:45.857 --> 00:11:49.648
Now push the heels of the feet
against each other -

00:11:49.648 --> 00:11:51.727
not the toes but the heels.

00:11:52.337 --> 00:11:53.587
Keep pushing.

00:11:53.967 --> 00:11:55.175
Keep pushing.

00:11:55.455 --> 00:11:56.797
Now hold.

00:11:57.436 --> 00:11:58.928
Hold this tension.

00:11:58.928 --> 00:12:00.200
Squeeze.

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.820
I want you to just notice,

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:03.252
just notice,

00:12:03.252 --> 00:12:05.238
what happened to the glute muscles

00:12:05.238 --> 00:12:08.678
as a consequence
of pushing the heels together.

00:12:09.607 --> 00:12:12.028
We didn't focus on these muscles,

00:12:12.544 --> 00:12:14.348
we focused on a movement.

00:12:14.908 --> 00:12:18.895
This is movement-first philosophy,
which I spoke of earlier.

00:12:19.298 --> 00:12:22.899
Focus on a movement;
muscles follow suit.

00:12:23.302 --> 00:12:24.928
We move efficiently.

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:28.809
The body recruits
the right muscles for the job.

00:12:29.478 --> 00:12:31.778
Standing here with your heels
pushed together

00:12:31.778 --> 00:12:33.779
is now your new stance.

00:12:34.339 --> 00:12:37.638
Actually, if I can get you guys
to hold this while I finish

00:12:37.659 --> 00:12:40.077
you might just have
to give me a standing ovation.

00:12:40.077 --> 00:12:41.489
(Laughter)

00:12:41.849 --> 00:12:44.715
By taking a lesson from my kid self.

00:12:45.305 --> 00:12:50.390
It took me two years at the age of 30
to finally get back my resting position.

00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:51.620
No, no.

00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:54.515
My resting position. (Laughs)

00:12:55.205 --> 00:12:58.316
Maybe we should all take a lesson
from our kid selves.

00:12:59.466 --> 00:13:03.663
We should stop teaching kids
how to sit on their ass,

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:05.852
we should lead by example,

00:13:06.442 --> 00:13:07.966
and move like them.

00:13:08.311 --> 00:13:09.555
Thank you.

00:13:09.555 --> 00:13:12.145
(Applause)
